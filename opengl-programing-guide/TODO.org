* TODO Var system
* EventQueue system
** Event Queue types
   - CREATE
   - REMOVE
   - MOVE
   - INPUT KEYBOARD
   - INPUT TRACKER
   - INPUT MOUSE
   - INPUT TOUCH
   - INPUT ANY
   - NETWORK
** Problems
   - Smoothness of input from multiple keys
   - Pull vs Push from input devices
   - Timestamps within Frametime
* TODO Game loop / Timmer
* Render system
** Shaders and required variables
** Display attributes
- Aspect ration
- FOV
- Output device(s)
** Ways to reference the model assets
   Entities require a way to associate themselves with models in the
   render system.  Do we use:
   - Pointers: fastest, but could break. This nullifies the design
     holdup a second
   - Some sort of ID lookup, string or numeric fasion: Lookup
     overhead, less likley to break.
   - Hybrid:
* TODO Scene Graph
  - Contains a positional representation of all entities in the world.
  - Used to determine who gets drawn at the current time.
  - Tells the entities to draw themsleves or tells the renderer to draw
    this set of entities
* TODO Asset manager
** Sounds
** Load Models from files
* Models
  A very broad term, Render physics, collision, sound.  Im sure there
  are more.  It gives us a way to perform these calculations somewhat
  quickly on entities.
** Discussion
   Require more information on how far to break this stuff out.
** Render Models
   What awe use to provide a visual representation of physical objects
   in a virtual world.
*** TODO Types
    - Load from equations
    - Load from files
*** Requirements
    - Points
    - Keyframes
    - Orientation
** TODO Collision Models
* Example Progress
  Most of these originated from the ex15_1.cpp file and brought in new
  ideas as I went along.
** exj_2
   - Proved the queue system
** exj_3
   - Broke out different model types.
   - Added a simple render system.
   - Added a entity class with camera and actor subs
** TODO exj_4
*** Come back into more OpenGL related items from book
*** Concentration on learning shaders
*** Concentrate on render model representation
*** Color support
*** Texture support
*** Get mouse integration
*** Gameloop/Timer integration
* Future Application Ideas
  Should inspiration come my way from this stuff put results here.
** Implement a version of Mathographics computer examples
** Give it oculus support
